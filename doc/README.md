# Project: The Effect of News and Tweets on the Price of Bitcoin
### Doc folder

Cryptocurrency is the talk of the town in todayâ€™s world. It is essentially a form of digital
currency, which any government or financial institution does not govern. It has gained rapid
popularity in recent years, which has further led to many applications accepting cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be launched in 2009, after which many more have been
launched in the market. However, bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency in use.
Bitcoins transactions primarily occur using peer-to-peer technology, replacing the need for a
third party, such as a central bank. Bitcoins are a highly volatile currency due to being controlled
directly by people rather than any government intermediary. Previous studies by Kristoufek and
American Institute for Economic Research (AIER) show the fluctuations in cryptocurrency
coinciding with dramatic events over the world and the price of such currencies being driven by
news sentiment (Kristoufek, 2015). We will take a deeper look at how these price fluctuations
are correlated with news and Twitter sentiments.
The **objective** of this project are to find out:

- Do the sentiments of tweets and news influence the price of Bitcoin?
- Does the value of the S&P 500 Index influence the price of Bitcoin?
- Which predictive model is the most optimal for predicting the price of the Bitcoin?
